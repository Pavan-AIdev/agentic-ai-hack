    "# üìã Multi-Agent Insurance Claim Orchestration\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "The `orchestration.ipynb` notebook implements a **sophisticated multi-agent orchestration system** for insurance claim processing using **Microsoft Semantic Kernel** and **Azure AI Agent Service**. This notebook demonstrates advanced concurrent agent coordination to analyze insurance claims from multiple specialized perspectives simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Technologies\n",
    "- **Microsoft Semantic Kernel**: Agent orchestration framework\n",

    "   - Analyzes timing, amounts, and circumstances\n",
    "   - Provides LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH risk assessments\n",
    "   - Equipped with Cosmos DB plugin for historical analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **üìã Policy Checker Agent**\n",
    "   - Validates coverage against policy terms\n",
    "   - Interprets limits, deductibles, and exclusions\n",
    "   - Handles multiple policy types (Auto, Commercial, Motorcycle, etc.)\n",
    "   - Provides COVERED/NOT COVERED/PARTIAL COVERAGE determinations\n",
    "   - Uses Azure AI Search for policy document analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîß Key Functions\n",
    "\n",

    "5. **Result Aggregation**: Collects and consolidates outputs from all agents\n",
    "6. **Report Generation**: Creates comprehensive analysis report with all findings\n",
    "7. **Resource Cleanup**: Properly terminates runtime and releases resources\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìä Output Format\n",
    "\n",
    "The system generates a comprehensive **Insurance Claim Analysis Report** that includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Individual Agent Assessments**: Detailed analysis from each specialized perspective\n",
    "- **Claim Validity Status**: Complete documentation and accuracy assessment\n",
    "- **Risk Profile Analysis**: Fraud indicators and authenticity evaluation\n",

    "- **Concurrent Execution**: True parallelism for faster processing\n",
    "- **Database Integration**: Real-time access to claim and policy data\n",
    "- **Flexible Configuration**: Environment-based model and endpoint configuration\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed progress tracking and status updates\n",
    "- **Timeout Management**: 5-minute timeout for orchestration completion\n",
    "- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of individual agent failures\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéØ Use Case Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook includes a practical example demonstrating the orchestration of claim analysis for \"CL002\", showing how the system processes claim details and retrieves additional data to provide comprehensive multi-agent analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation represents a cutting-edge approach to insurance claim processing, leveraging the power of concurrent AI agents to provide thorough, multi-perspective analysis that would traditionally require multiple human experts working in sequence.\n"

      "- Property Damage Liability presumably covers damages you cause to third-party property (not explicitly stated in the snippet but common in liability policies).\n",
      "- Likely contains limits and exclusions typical to liability-only auto policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Relevant excerpts supporting conclusion:\n",
      "- \"This liability-only auto insurance policy provides the minimum required coverage to legally drive in most states. It covers damages and injuries you cause to others but does not cover damage to your own vehicle or injuries to yourself.\" (Section 1: Coverage Overview)\n",
      "- \"Section 2.1: Bodily Injury Liability - Medical expenses for injured third parties - Lost wages of injured parties - Pain and suffering compensation - Rehabilitation costs for injured parties - Legal defense costs for covered claims - Court-ordered judgments and settlements\"„Äê3:2‚Ä†liability_only_policy.md„Äë\n",
      "\n",
      "Explanation:\n",
      "Because this policy only covers liability to third parties, it does not cover any damage to the insured's vehicle or medical costs for the insured. Any claim for liability damages (e.g., injury or property damage to others) would be covered up to policy limits. Claims for vehicle damage or personal injury to the insured would be excluded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, whether the credit on the claim should be approved depends on if the claim filed falls under liability coverage (third party injury/property damage). If the claim is for liability damages within policy limits, coverage is provided. If the claim is for first party damages (to insured vehicle or personal injuries), the claim is not covered under this policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "I recommend reviewing the claim detail documents to identify the nature of the claim (liability vs. first party) for a final credit approval decision. Based on the policy language alone, coverage determination is:\n",
      "\n",
      "- COVERED if claim is for third party bodily injury or property damage liability within limits.\n",
      "- NOT COVERED if claim relates to own vehicle damage or self injury.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please confirm claim type for final approval.\n",

      "Analysis:\n",
      "- Claim Details: The claim CL001 relates to a vehicle incident on July 17, 2025, involving a 2004 Honda Accord parked legally and struck by a gray pickup truck, causing significant front left and driver side damage. The documentation includes photos, a police report, and repair estimates from Springfield Auto Body. The description of damages is detailed and consistent with the incident and supporting images.\n",
      "- Completeness: The claim is well-documented with police report, witness contact, and repair shop estimate. Photos confirm physical damage consistent with reported incident.\n",
      "- Damage and Cost Estimates: The described damages (bumper detached, dented quarter panel, damaged wheel and headlamp, paint transfer) and image captions align with moderate to severe impact potentially affecting structural and mechanical components. Repair costs are expected to be substantial but no specific cost figures were retrieved to assess reasonableness against industry standards.\n",
      "- Policy Coverage: No policy documentation or terms were retrieved for policy number LIAB-AUTO-001, preventing validation of coverage terms, limits, exclusions, or deductible applicability.\n",
      "- Concerns: Lack of retrieved policy documents leaves coverage applicability uncertain. The claim notes an additional unrelated crash under a different policy, which does not affect this claim's validity but should be cross-referenced to avoid double claims. Repair estimates or exact repair cost figures are missing, preventing a full cost validation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Missing Info / Concerns:\n",
      "- No policy document found to confirm coverage, limits, or exclusions.\n",
      "- No detailed repair cost breakdown retrieved for assessment.\n",
      "- Verification needed on whether the damage estimate includes hidden mechanical damage claims.\n",
      "- Confirmation on claimant's compliance with claim submission timing and deductible amounts is pending.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next Steps:\n",
      "1. Retrieve and review the actual policy LIAB-AUTO-001 documents to confirm coverage, exclusions, and deductible.\n",
      "2. Obtain a detailed itemized repair estimate with costs and cross-check against typical industry standards for similar damages.\n",
      "3. Validate claimant's compliance with policy conditions (timely reporting, deductible payment).\n",
      "4. Contact repair shop and police department for any additional corroboration if discrepancies arise.\n",
      "5. Pending these validations, recommend temporary provisional approval with hold on final payment until coverage and cost reasonableness confirmed.\n",
