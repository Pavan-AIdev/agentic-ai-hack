    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Use Case Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook includes a practical example demonstrating the orchestration of claim analysis for \"CL002\", showing how the system processes claim details and retrieves additional data to provide comprehensive multi-agent analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation represents a cutting-edge approach to insurance claim processing, leveraging the power of concurrent AI agents to provide thorough, multi-perspective analysis that would traditionally require multiple human experts working in sequence.\n"

      "\n",
      "Main important details:\n",
      "- This policy is a Liability Only Auto Insurance policy.\n",
      "- Covers damages and injuries you cause to others (third parties).\n",
      "- Does NOT cover damage to your own vehicle or your own injuries.\n",
      "- Bodily Injury Liability coverage includes medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, rehabilitation, legal defense costs, and settlements or judgments.\n",
      "- Property Damage Liability presumably covers damages you cause to third-party property (not explicitly stated in the snippet but common in liability policies).\n",
      "- Likely contains limits and exclusions typical to liability-only auto policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Relevant excerpts supporting conclusion:\n",
      "- \"This liability-only auto insurance policy provides the minimum required coverage to legally drive in most states. It covers damages and injuries you cause to others but does not cover damage to your own vehicle or injuries to yourself.\" (Section 1: Coverage Overview)\n",
      "- \"Section 2.1: Bodily Injury Liability - Medical expenses for injured third parties - Lost wages of injured parties - Pain and suffering compensation - Rehabilitation costs for injured parties - Legal defense costs for covered claims - Court-ordered judgments and settlements\"【3:2†liability_only_policy.md】\n",
      "\n",
      "Explanation:\n",
      "Because this policy only covers liability to third parties, it does not cover any damage to the insured's vehicle or medical costs for the insured. Any claim for liability damages (e.g., injury or property damage to others) would be covered up to policy limits. Claims for vehicle damage or personal injury to the insured would be excluded.\n",
      "\n",

If the claim is for liability damages within policy limits, coverage is provided.

      "- Claim Details: The claim CL001 relates to a vehicle incident on July 17, 2025, involving a 2004 Honda Accord parked legally and struck by a gray pickup truck, causing significant front left and driver side damage. The documentation includes photos, a police report, and repair estimates from Springfield Auto Body. The description of damages is detailed and consistent with the incident and supporting images.\n",
      "- Completeness: The claim is well-documented with police report, witness contact, and repair shop estimate. Photos confirm physical damage consistent with reported incident.\n",
      "- Damage and Cost Estimates: The described damages (bumper detached, dented quarter panel, damaged wheel and headlamp, paint transfer) and image captions align with moderate to severe impact potentially affecting structural and mechanical components. Repair costs are expected to be substantial but no specific cost figures were retrieved to assess reasonableness against industry standards.\n",
      "- Policy Coverage: No policy documentation or terms were retrieved for policy number LIAB-AUTO-001, preventing validation of coverage terms, limits, exclusions, or deductible applicability.\n",
      "- Concerns: Lack of retrieved policy documents leaves coverage applicability uncertain. The claim notes an additional unrelated crash under a different policy, which does not affect this claim's validity but should be cross-referenced to avoid double claims. Repair estimates or exact repair cost figures are missing, preventing a full cost validation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Missing Info / Concerns:\n",
      "- No policy document found to confirm coverage, limits, or exclusions.\n",
      "- No detailed repair cost breakdown retrieved for assessment.\n",
      "- Verification needed on whether the damage estimate includes hidden mechanical damage claims.\n",
      "- Confirmation on claimant's compliance with claim submission timing and deductible amounts is pending.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next Steps:\n",
      "1. Retrieve and review the actual policy LIAB-AUTO-001 documents to confirm coverage, exclusions, and deductible.\n",
      "2. Obtain a detailed itemized repair estimate with costs and cross-check against typical industry standards for similar damages.\n",
      "3. Validate claimant's compliance with policy conditions (timely reporting, deductible payment).\n",
      "4. Contact repair shop and police department for any additional corroboration if discrepancies arise.\n",
      "5. Pending these validations, recommend temporary provisional approval with hold on final payment until coverage and cost reasonableness confirmed.\n",
